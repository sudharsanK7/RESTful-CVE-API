CVE-2021-32628,HIGH,7.5,"redis-server, redis-tools","Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. An integer overflow bug in the ziplist data structure used by all versions of Redis can be exploited to corrupt the heap and potentially result with remote code execution. The vulnerability involves modifying the default ziplist configuration parameters (hash-max-ziplist-entries, hash-max-ziplist-value, zset-max-ziplist-entries or zset-max-ziplist-value) to a very large value, and then constructing specially crafted commands to create very large ziplists. The problem is fixed in Redis versions 6.2.6, 6.0.16, 5.0.14. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server executable is to prevent users from modifying the above configuration parameters. This can be done using ACL to restrict unprivileged users from using the CONFIG SET command.",CWE-190
CVE-2016-1585,CRITICAL,9.8,"apparmor, libapparmor1",In all versions of AppArmor mount rules are accidentally widened when compiled,CWE-254
CVE-2021-20308,CRITICAL,9.8,"htmldoc, htmldoc-common",Integer overflow in the htmldoc 1.9.11 and before may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code and cause a denial of service that is similar to CVE-2017-9181.,CWE-190
CVE-2021-4048,CRITICAL,9.1,libblas3,"An out-of-bounds read flaw was found in the CLARRV, DLARRV, SLARRV, and ZLARRV functions in lapack through version 3.10.0, as also used in OpenBLAS before version 0.3.18. Specially crafted inputs passed to these functions could cause an application using lapack to crash or possibly disclose portions of its memory.",CWE-125
CVE-2022-36227,CRITICAL,9.8,libarchive13,"In libarchive before 3.6.2, the software does not check for an error after calling calloc function that can return with a NULL pointer if the function fails, which leads to a resultant NULL pointer dereference. NOTE: the discoverer cites this CWE-476 remark but third parties dispute the codeexecution impact: ""In rare circumstances, when NULL is equivalent to the 0x0 memory address and privileged code can access it, then writing or reading memory is possible, which may lead to code execution.""",CWE-476
CVE-2021-3697,HIGH,7,"grub-common, grub-pc, grub-pc-bin, grub2-common","A crafted JPEG image may lead the JPEG reader to underflow its data pointer, allowing user-controlled data to be written in heap. To a successful to be performed the attacker needs to perform some triage over the heap layout and craft an image with a malicious format and payload. This vulnerability can lead to data corruption and eventual code execution or secure boot circumvention. This flaw affects grub2 versions prior grub-2.12.",CWE-787
CVE-2021-38091,HIGH,8.8,"libavcodec58, libavutil56, libswresample3","Integer Overflow vulnerability in function filter16_sobel in libavfilter/vf_convolution.c in Ffmpeg 4.2.1, allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service or other unspecified impacts.",CWE-190
CVE-2016-2781,MEDIUM,6.5,coreutils,"chroot in GNU coreutils, when used with --userspec, allows local users to escape to the parent session via a crafted TIOCSTI ioctl call, which pushes characters to the terminal's input buffer.",CWE-20
CVE-2016-9802,MEDIUM,5.3,"bluez, libbluetooth3","In BlueZ 5.42, a buffer over-read was identified in ""l2cap_packet"" function in ""monitor/packet.c"" source file. This issue can be triggered by processing a corrupted dump file and will result in btmon crash.",CWE-119
CVE-2019-1563,LOW,3.7,libnode72,"In situations where an attacker receives automated notification of the success or failure of a decryption attempt an attacker, after sending a very large number of messages to be decrypted, can recover a CMS/PKCS7 transported encryption key or decrypt any RSA encrypted message that was encrypted with the public RSA key, using a Bleichenbacher padding oracle attack. Applications are not affected if they use a certificate together with the private RSA key to the CMS_decrypt or PKCS7_decrypt functions to select the correct recipient info to decrypt. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0l (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0k). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2t (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2s).",CWE-327
